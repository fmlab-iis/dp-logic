The semantics over Markov chains generalizes to Markov decision
processes as well. Note that two states with different enabled actions
are trivially distinguishable; no privacy can be preserved. Without
loss of generality, we consider reactive Markov decision processes.
Let $M = (S, \Act, \wp, L)$ be a reactive Markov
decision process. Define the satisfaction
relation $M, \neighbor{S}, s \models \Phi$ as follows.
\begin{eqnarray*}
  M, \neighbor{S}, s \models \top\\
  M, \neighbor{S}, s \models p
  & \textmd{ if } &
  p \in L(s)\\
  M, \neighbor{S}, s \models \neg \Phi
  & \textmd{ if } &
  M, \neighbor{S}, s \not\models \Phi\\
  M, \neighbor{S}, s \models \Phi_0 \wedge \Phi_1
  & \textmd{ if } &
  M, \neighbor{S}, s \models \Phi_0 \textmd{ and }
  M, \neighbor{S}, s \models \Phi_1\\
  M, \neighbor{S}, s \models \PJ{J} \phi
  & \textmd{ if } &
  \myPr{s}{M_{\scheduler{S}}}{\neighbor{S}}{\phi} \in J
  \textmd{ for every scheduler } \scheduler{S}\\
  M, \neighbor{S}, s \models \dpriv{\epsilon}{\delta} \phi
  & \textmd{ if } &
  \textmd{for all } t \textmd{ with } s \neighbor{S} t \textmd{ and
   position-independent scheduler } \\
  & & \scheduler{S},
   \myPr{s}{M_{\scheduler{S}}}{\neighbor{S}}{\phi} \leq \epsilon \cdot
   \myPr{t}{M_{\scheduler{S}}}{\neighbor{S}}{\phi} + \delta
   \textmd{ and }
   \myPr{t}{M_{\scheduler{S}}}{\neighbor{S}}{\phi} \leq \epsilon \cdot
  \\
  & &
   \myPr{s}{M_{\scheduler{S}}}{\neighbor{S}}{\phi} + \delta
\end{eqnarray*}

\lz{how about using "query sequence" instead of position-independent scheduler, and then argue that it makes sense for the resulting MDP model from differential privacy? This corresponds to a special scheduler that is applied on both neighboring states. }
Recall that $M_{\scheduler{S}}$ is but a Markov chain. The semantics
of $M_{\scheduler{S}}, \neighbor{S}, \pi \models \phi$ and hence the
probability $\myPr{s}{M_{\scheduler{S}}}{\neighbor{S}}{\phi}$ are
defined as in Markov chains.
The semantics of $\dpCTL$ on reactive Markov decision processes
is again standard except the differentially private operator
$\dpriv{\epsilon}{\delta}$. For any path formula $\phi$,
$\dpriv{\epsilon}{\delta} \phi$ specifies states which are $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-close to all its neighbors in having paths satisfying $\phi$
for arbitrary position-independent schedulers. That is, no
position-independent scheduler can force any of neighbors to have
probabilistically distinguishable behaviors.

\noindent
\emph{Discussion.}
Another definition of the differentially private operator
might be:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  M, \neighbor{S}, s \models \dpriv{\epsilon}{\delta}^{\mathit{bad}} \phi
  & \textmd{ if } &
  \textmd{for all } t \textmd{ with } s \neighbor{S} t \textmd{ and
  scheduler } \scheduler{S},
  \myPr{s}{M_{\scheduler{S}}}{\neighbor{S}}{\phi} \leq
  \epsilon \cdot\\
  && \myPr{t}{M_{\scheduler{S}}}{\neighbor{S}}{\phi} + \delta \textmd{ and }
  \myPr{t}{M_{\scheduler{S}}}{\neighbor{S}}{\phi} \leq
  \epsilon \cdot \myPr{s}{M_{\scheduler{S}}}{\neighbor{S}}{\phi}
  + \delta
\end{eqnarray*}
A state satisfies $\dpriv{\epsilon}{\delta}^{\mathit{bad}} \phi$ if
no scheduler could differentiate the probabilities of paths satisfying
$\phi$ from neighbors. Such a definition would allow strategies to
take different actions from different states. It might need different
action sequences to distinguish neighbors. Two neighbors could still be
differentiated by a action sequence and lose their privacy. We hence
prefer the original definition.

\hide{
Since the scheduler attaining the maximally probable
behavior from a state may be different from the scheduler attaining
the maximally probable behavior from its neighbors, two
neighbors may still be distinguished by a scheduler. The
weaker definition does not preserve differential privacy. We hence
prefer the original definition.
